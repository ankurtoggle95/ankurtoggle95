## 💼 Selected Architectural Highlights (Private Work)

Most of my work resides in private client or proprietary repositories.  
Here are some high-level summaries of the systems I architected and delivered:

---

### **1. Multi-Tenant SaaS Financial Platform**

A robust, highly available platform supporting dozens of independent businesses with custom billing and compliance requirements.

- **Challenge:**  
  Designing a flexible data model that isolates tenant data while maintaining centralized billing, auth, and compliance visibility.

- **Architecture:**  
  Microservices + internal API Gateway, PostgreSQL for core data, Redis for session + rate limiting.

- **Key Features:**  
  - Centralized billing engine (subscription + usage-based plans)  
  - Fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
  - Comprehensive, tamper-proof audit logging  
  - Scalable multi-tenant data isolation patterns

### **2. High-Performance E-commerce Checkout Engine**

A BigCommerce-integrated custom checkout workflow engineered to handle extreme logistics complexity.

- **Challenge:**  
  Real-time courier aggregation for **34,000+ pincodes**, multiple zones, and dynamic pricing — all under 100ms.

- **Architecture:**  
  A high-speed FastAPI service deployed close to the edge; optimized geospatial + inventory calculations layered with advanced caching.

- **Key Features:**  
  - Dynamic custom pricing and discount engines  
  - Multi-zone shipping calculation logic  
  - Centralized payment routing  
  - Reduced checkout latency and improved conversion rates

### **3. AI-Driven AdTech Optimization Platform**

An ML-powered optimization toolkit for performance marketers focused on ROAS and CAC improvement.

- **Challenge:**  
  Ingesting, cleaning, and analyzing massive real-time event data from Facebook Marketing APIs and converting them into actionable signals.

- **Architecture:**  
  Queue-driven ingestion → Data lake storage → ML pipelines (Pandas, Scikit-learn) → Automated bidding + targeting rules.

- **Impact:**  
  - Automated reporting dashboards  
  - Predictive budget allocation and campaign updates  
  - Significant gains in ROAS and operational efficiency
